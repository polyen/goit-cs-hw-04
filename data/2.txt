The bustling city of Metropolis was known for its towering skyscrapers and never-ending energy. Among the crowd, Sarah was just another face in the sea of people. She worked at a marketing firm, where the pressure was high, and the deadlines were tight. Every day felt like a race against the clock. But Sarah had a secret escape â€“ the rooftop garden of her apartment building. After long days at work, she would retreat to this oasis of calm, surrounded by vibrant flowers and the distant hum of the city below. One evening, as the sun set, casting a golden glow over the city, she met James, a fellow resident who shared her love for the garden. They quickly became friends, bonding over their love for nature in the midst of the urban jungle. Over time, their friendship blossomed into something more. They spent countless evenings on the rooftop, watching the stars and dreaming about the future. In a city that never slept, Sarah found peace and love in the most unexpected place. The rooftop garden became their sanctuary, a reminder that beauty and serenity could be found even in the busiest places.
